# Wordy Arithmetic Chains

Write a program that takes a word problem in the format:

> What is 5 plus -13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

> What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?

> What is 9 minus 3 plus 5?

> What is 3 plus 5 minus 8?

and returns the answer as an integer.

Use the tests to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test at a time.

## Extensions

Handle all permutations of plus, minus, multiplied by, and divided by.

Make sure you have failing tests for any code you implement.
