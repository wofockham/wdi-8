# Wordy Addition

Write a program that takes a word problem in the format:

> What is 5 plus 13?

and returns the answer as an integer.

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

Use the tests to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test at a time.

## Extensions

1. Modify your program to also handle problems of the type:

> What is 7 plus 9 plus 3?

Remember to write failing tests for this.
